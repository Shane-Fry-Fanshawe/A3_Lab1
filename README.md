# A3_Lab1 - Shane Fry

In the following Lab, I will be responsible for adding content into the car website using techniques used in class with javascript. This will require swapping out information that corresponds with the correct car selected to do so follow these steps:

In the carData.js file, create the appropriate properties in each of the car objects (model, price, description) using the supplied car_data.txt text file
Write the JS variables / event handling / functions to retrieve the data and populate the elements on the index.html page.
When you click on a car thumb, the OTHER ones should fade out so that only the active one is full opacity (there's a CSS class near the bottom of the overrides.css file to use)
